        This program is used to delete data on hard drives. It begins in safe mode,

        being shredded.

        Switching from safe mode to shred mode will enable hard drive shredding.
        This program will automatically begin shredding any newly detected drives 
        while in shred mode. This mean if you attach a hard drive while in shred mode,
        data on that drive will automatically be DESTROYED.

        NOTE: All protected drives should be connected for a minimum of a minute
        before starting this script. Verify the protected device list looks 
        correct before entering shred mode\n''')
