    Welcome to the Free Geek Shred Program! :)

    This program is used to delete data on hard drives. It begins in safe mode,
    which will protect any drives attached (internal or external) from being
    shredded.

    Switching from safe mode to shred mode will enable hard drive shredding.
    This program will automatically begin shredding any newly detected drives 
    while in shred mode. This mean if you attach a hard drive while in shred mode,
    data on that drive will automatically be DESTROYED.

    NOTE: All protected drives should be connected for a minimum of a minute
    before starting this script. Verify the protected device list looks 
    correct before entering shred mode\n''')
